## 🖥️ Application Overview

The Signal Equalizer is a browser-based app that lets you upload any audio or ECG signal and interactively adjust its frequency components in real time. Every slider move instantly updates the waveform viewers, frequency spectrum, wavelet energy chart, and spectrograms — all synchronized.

---

### Main Interface

The toolbar at the top gives you instant access to every control — mode selector, file upload, config save/load, and AI compare.
<img width="1907" height="422" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5080eeb-b474-429b-bad6-3744793b3efd" />
![Full Application View](docs/screenshots/full-app.png)

---

### Waveform Viewers

Two linked cine viewers — **blue** for input, **pink** for output. Zoom with the scroll wheel, pan by dragging, and both viewers stay in perfect sync.

---

### Playback & Controls

Play, Pause, Stop, and adjustable speed (0.25× to 4×). Zoom and pan buttons. Spectrogram toggle. Linear / Audiogram FFT scale switch.

---

### Frequency Spectrum Chart

Input and output plotted together in real time. **Linear** shows the full range from 0 Hz to Nyquist. **Audiogram** uses a logarithmic X axis at 125 Hz → 8 kHz (ISO 8253-1 hearing-test standard).

![FFT Chart](docs/screenshots/fft-chart.png)

---

### Spectrogram Viewers

Two high-resolution 2D time-frequency heatmaps — input and output. Axes auto-adapt to the signal's actual sample rate. The output spectrogram updates within ~55 ms of any slider change.
<img width="418" height="556" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb1d1cc1-95f2-4d56-bd6a-02ef9bbf1140" />


---

### Three Equalization Systems

Each custom mode exposes three independent systems. Only one is active at a time — the active system drives the output viewers and audio. Inactive systems are visually dimmed.

---

### System A — Frequency Domain

Sliders scale the FFT magnitude bins within each configured frequency range. Precise, instant, and works in every mode.

<img width="1495" height="720" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a95509dd-bfd7-402c-90e1-ae19fab3732d" />

---

### System B — Wavelet Domain

Sliders control DWT coefficient energy per band using an exclusive level assignment that prevents bands from compounding gains on shared DWT levels.

<img width="947" height="610" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b652d3b-e8a8-463f-ac61-7eb0ccd33432" />

---

### System C — AI Source Separation

Click **🔬 Separate Signal** once to run the AI model. Gain sliders appear immediately — one per separated component. Every slider move is an instant weighted sum; no re-separation needed.

<img width="792" height="528" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b2c84b6-4f6d-4a27-8972-d7094bb86668" />

**Separated components:**
One component per detected animal sound class (e.g. Dog bark, Bird call, Cat meow) — depends on what's in the recording.

**How to use:**
1. Select **🐾 Animals** from the Mode dropdown
2. Upload a recording containing animal sounds
3. Use **System A** / **System B** sliders to equalize the full mix
4. Activate **System C** → click **🔬 Separate Signal** → one card per detected animal class
5. Mute or boost individual animal sources with the gain sliders
6. Click ▶ Play on any card to hear that animal in isolation
7. Use the **Animals Compare Panel** to benchmark YAMNet vs Wavelet with SNR, SI-SNR, PRD, and LSD metrics

### 🗣️ Voices Mode

Separates overlapping speech into individual speaker tracks using **ConvTasNet** via the Asteroid library.

**Separated components:**
Speaker 1, Speaker 2, Speaker 3, ... — as many as detected in the recording.

**How to use:**
1. Select **🗣️ Voices** from the Mode dropdown
2. Upload a recording with multiple or overlapping speakers
3. Use **System A** / **System B** sliders to equalize the full mix
4. Activate **System C** → click **🔬 Separate Signal** → one card per detected speaker
5. Adjust individual speaker volumes with the gain sliders
6. Click ▶ Play on any card to hear that speaker alone
7. Use the **Voices Compare Panel** to benchmark ConvTasNet vs Wavelet using SNR, SI-SNR, PRD, and LSD metrics

> 💡 **Tip:** Human voices overlap heavily in frequency. System A and B equalize the mix as a whole — for per-speaker volume control, use **System C**.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.10** or newer
- **Chrome** browser (recommended)
- **ffmpeg** on PATH — required by Demucs for music separation

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Task2_Signal_Equalizer
```

### Step 2 — Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv

# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac / Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3 — Install core dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn numpy scipy pywavelets soundfile python-multipart pandas
```

### Step 4 — Install AI dependencies *(optional — only needed for System C)*

```bash
# Instruments mode — Demucs music separation
pip install demucs
pip install soundfile==0.11.0       # fixes SoundFileRuntimeError with Demucs

# Animals mode — YAMNet classifier
pip install torch torchaudio

# Voices mode — ConvTasNet speaker separation
pip install asteroid

# ECG mode — ResNet arrhythmia classification
pip install torch wfdb               # wfdb adds support for .dat/.hea WFDB files
```

> **Windows note:** If Demucs fails with `[WinError 2]`, the app automatically falls back to `python -m demucs`. If you see a `TorchCodec` error, run `pip install torchcodec` or downgrade with `pip install torchaudio==2.1.2`.

### Step 5 — Install ffmpeg

**Windows:**
```bash
winget install ffmpeg
```

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Verify:**
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

### Step 6 — Generate the test signal *(optional)*

```bash
cd backend
python generate_synthetic.py
```

Creates `data/samples/synthetic_signal.wav` — a 5-second signal with **10 pure sine waves** at 100, 300, 500, 1k, 2k, 4k, 6k, 8k, 10k, and 12k Hz. Load it into the app and each frequency appears as a sharp spike in the FFT chart — ideal for verifying equalization is working correctly.

---

## 🚀 Running the App

### Step 1 — Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Expected output:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
INFO:     Started reloader process
```

Interactive API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Step 2 — Open the frontend

Open `frontend/index.html` directly in **Chrome**.

The toolbar should show **● Backend OK** in green.
If it shows **Backend Offline**, check that Step 1 is still running.

> No build step or proxy needed. CORS is fully enabled.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Signal Processing Pipeline

```
Upload WAV / MP3 / CSV / WFDB
           ↓
Backend: soundfile → mono Float32 numpy array → stored in memory
           ↓
User moves a slider  (55 ms debounce)
           ↓
POST /api/equalize                         POST /api/ai/mix
  ├─ System A (FFT):                         └─ output = Σ (component_i × gain_i)
  │    rfft → scale bins → irfft                    returns original if all gains = 1.0
  └─ System B (Wavelet):
       wavedec → exclusive DWT level assignment
       → scale coefficients → waverec
           ↓
Result encoded as base64 WAV → browser
           ↓
Browser: OfflineAudioContext.decodeAudioData → Float32Array
         → CineViewer + FFT chart + Wavelet chart + Spectrograms
```

### Key Design Decisions

**Exclusive DWT level ownership**
Each DWT coefficient array is assigned to exactly one user band — the one with the greatest Hz overlap. This prevents multiple sliders from compounding gains on shared levels. Setting a slider to 0× truly silences those frequencies.

**AI separation caching**
The slow AI model runs once per signal and caches the component waveforms server-side. Every subsequent slider move calls `/api/ai/mix` — a pure NumPy weighted sum — so it's instant regardless of signal length.

**ECG sample rate handling**
ECG files are resampled to 360 Hz before classification (MIT-BIH training standard), then each component is resampled back to the original file's sample rate for storage and playback. If no beats are detected, an FFT-band fallback always produces 5 components.

**Schema-driven frontend**
The frontend has zero hardcoded mode knowledge. All sliders are generated dynamically from a JSON settings file. Adding a new mode requires only a new JSON file in `data/settings/`.

**Per-system audio routing**
Three independent `AudioBufferSourceNode` instances — one per system. Playing one stops the others. The **🔊 Input** button encodes the raw `Float32Array` to WAV entirely in the browser with no server round-trip.

### Optimal Wavelet Per Mode

| Mode | Wavelet | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Instruments | db6 | High vanishing moments — captures smooth tonal signals |
| Animals | db4 | Compact support — handles short transient bursts |
| Voices | Haar | Fast and simple |
| ECG | db4 | Established biomedical standard for QRS analysis |

### Settings File Format

```json
{
  "mode": "Musical Instruments",
  "sliders": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Kick Drum",   "ranges": [{ "min": 40,   "max": 100   }] },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Bass Guitar", "ranges": [{ "min": 100,  "max": 400   }] },
    { "id": 3, "name": "Flute",       "ranges": [{ "min": 1500, "max": 4000  }] },
    { "id": 4, "name": "Cymbals",     "ranges": [{ "min": 8000, "max": 16000 }] }
  ]
}
```

A single slider can span multiple non-contiguous ranges:

```json
{ "id": 3, "name": "Drums", "ranges": [{ "min": 50, "max": 200 }, { "min": 4000, "max": 8000 }] }
```
